### How to use

1. First, obtain and place the 'kanji.json' file in the directory

```bash title="Source"
# Get from: https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data/blob/master/kanji.json
```

2. Run the upload script with the following command

```bash title="Upload files"
bun run genUpload.ts
```

3. Finally, you'll be left with a 'kanji_upload_errors.json' file which contains the entries that couldn't be processed automatically. You can manually resolve them using the Supabase dashboard
