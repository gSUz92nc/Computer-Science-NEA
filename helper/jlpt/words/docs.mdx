### How to use

1. First generate the 'uploads.json' with the following command

```bash title="Gen files"
bun run genUploads.ts
```

2. Then upload the files to supabase with the following command

```bash title="Upload files"
bun run uploadFiles.ts
```

3. Finally, you'll be left with a 'empty.json' file which contains the entries that couldn't be resolved automatically. You can manually resolve them and then upload them using the supabase dashbaord
